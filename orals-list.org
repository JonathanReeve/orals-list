* Oral Exam Reading List
This oral exam reading list is centered around a major field of British literary
modernism. Although literary modernism, as conceived here, is a protean and
permeable designation, rather than a circumscribed category, the writers most
represented in this list, such as Joyce, Woolf, and Yeats, are typical of a
modernist survey course. The list expands outward from these writers, however,
and includes those published alongside them in the influential "little
magazines" of the 1910s and 20s, as well as a few non-British writers working in
Britain or its colonies. A minor list of Victorian literature, which the moderns
reacted to, and in many ways extended, provides a necessary background. This is
not a list, however, which is completely distinct from the modernist list, as
some writers, like Thomas Hardy, appear in both. Here, well-known novelists such
as Dickens, Stevenson, and Eliot, appear alongside theorists like Arnold
and Ruskin. Influential journals, such as the decadent '90s /The Yellow Book/,
are also included. The secondary minor list is methodological, and contains recent
books and articles concerning computational approaches to literary style. Since
computational methods are an interdisciplinary by nature, some of these articles
extend into the fields of statistics, corpus linguistics, and natural language
processing. Although the list was curated to select a wide variety of
methodological approaches, articles that treat the works of British modernists
or Victorian writers are most represented here. These lists are linked in other
ways, as well, such as through complementary pairs: Charlotte BrontÃ«'s /Jane
Eyre/ with Jean Rhys's reworking /The Wide Sargasso Sea/, for example. The
subjects of quantitative analyses are similarly paired: Mahlberg's /Corpus
Stylistics and Dickens's Fiction/ deals primarily with /David Copperfield/;
Ramsay's /Reading Machines/ and Balossi's "A Corpus Linguistic Approach to
Literary Language and Characterization" analyze Woolf's /The Waves/; Zhao's "Art
of Balance" discusses /To the Lighthouse/, and McKenna's "Statistical Analysis
of Style" deals with /Ulysses/.

** TODO Major Field: British Modernism

Although the boundaries of literary modernism extend with every new monograph on
the subject, and although it is often pluralized to "modernisms," better
reflecting the international nature of the cultural phenomenon, this list is
primarily modeled after the readings of a survey course in British modernism,
and contains mostly canonical writers typically associated with the period,
either British, or writing from Britain or its colonies. This departs from the
typical survey course, however, in its inclusion of the 1910s and 20s journals
and little magazines in which many of these works were originally published:
Anderson's /The Little Review/, Lewis's /Blast/, Ford's /The English Review/,
and Pound's editorship of /The Dial/. These are selected not to provide
alternative editions of the canonical works included here, but to provide
contexts for the publishing environment of early modernism. Chronologically,
this list chiefly includes the generation alive and working in the 10s and 20s,
so although the temporal boundary of modernism is often drawn in the 1930s, I am
extending it to include, in some cases, the writers' later works: Woolf's 1941
/Between the Acts/, Pound's middle Cantos, and Jean Rhys's 1966 /The Wide
Sargasso Sea/. There are also works of nonfiction that were either explicitly
influential to these writers, or in some other way informed the zeitgeist:
Frazer's /Golden Bough/, Freud's /Interpretation of Dreams/, and Pound's /ABC of
Reading/, for instance. A secondary list, below the divider, contains seminal
works of criticism that discuss these writers, their era, their literary
movement, or the publishing environment in which they worked.

** Minor Field: Victorian Literature

As period adjacent to British modernism, the Victorian period forms an important
background to it. This minor list represents works selected from those commonly
taught in a survey course of Victorian literature. It consists primarily of
novels, with selected poems by Tennyson, Hopkins, and Rosetti. There are also
two plays: George Bernard Shaw's "Mrs Warren's Profession," and Oscar Wilde's
"The Importance of Being Earnest." Works known for their realism (/Middlemarch/)
or naturalism (/Tess of the d'Ubervilles/) are paired with works that deal with
the supernatural (/The Moonstone/, /Dracula/). Also included are two non-fiction
works from Victorian critics and essayists: Arnold's /Culture and Anarchy/ and
Ruskin's /Selected Writings/. Two journals are included: the decadent 1890s /The
Yellow Book/, and the more populist /The Graphic/, especially for their
influence on literary modernism.

** Minor Field: Computational Approaches to the Study of Literary Style

This minor reading list collects computational approaches to the study of
literary style, an interdisciplinary methodological category that spans the
fields of the digital humanities, stylistics, and corpus linguistics. As style
is a variously interpreted, broad category, this list is subdivided into studies
of genre, character style (characterization), gendered style, the style of
"literariness," and style in translation. A few early quantitative analyses are
included here, in order to provide background; approaches to the study of
individual writers' styles, including statistical stylistics (stylometry) are
also included, extending into the sub-field of authorship attribution. Finally,
important objections to computational methods, and to stylistics more generally,
are included, as they are frequently referenced in these studies.
